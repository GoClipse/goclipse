#### Setting up the development environment:
 * You need [Eclipse PDE](https://eclipse.org/pde/) to develop Eclipse plugins. Download and start it.
 * Clone the Git repository.
 * In Eclipse, click "File / Import... ", and then "General / Existing projects into workspace". Select the Git repository folder as the "root directory", and select all the Eclipse projects that show up. Click finish to import those projects.

<sub><sup>Note: The actual project names will be different from those in the screenshot above.</sup></sub>
</div>
 * Note: Java compiler settings will be automatically configured, since Eclipse compiler settings are stored in source version control.
 * Setup the target platform: Open the target platform file: `releng/target-platform/IDE.target` (You can use the Open Resource dialog to help find this file, press Ctrl-R and type `IDE.target` in the dialog). Then click "Set as Target Platform" once the file is opened, as seen here: 
<div align="center">

</div>
 * Build the workspace ( "Project / Build All"). Everything should build fine now, there should be no errors.
 * To start the IDE from your workspace: Open "Run / Run Configurations ...". Click on "Eclipse Application" to create a new launch for the plugins in your workspace. The default new configuration that is created should already be ready to be launched.

#### Running the tests in Eclipse:
 * In `releng/launches` there is one or several Eclipse launch files for running the tests, so if this project is added to your Eclipse workspace, the launches will show up automatically in `Run Configurations...`, as "JUnit Plug-in Tests". 

#### Automated Building and Testing:
Using Maven (and Tycho), it is possible to automatically build Goclipse, create an update site, and run all the tests. Download [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (minimum version 3.0), and run the following commands on the root folder of the repository:
 * Run `mvn package` to build the IDE feature into a p2 repository (which is a local update site).  It will be placed at `bin-maven/features.repository/repository`
 * Run `mvn integration-test` to build the IDE as above and also run the test suites.

#### Creating and deploying a new release:
A release is a web site with an Eclipse p2 update site. The website may contain no web pages at all, rather it can be just the p2 site. To create and deploy a new release:

 1. Ensure the version numbers of all plugins/features/etc. are properly updated, if they haven't been already.
 1. Run `mvn clean integration-test` to perform the Tycho build (see section above). Ensure all tests pass.
   * To create a signed release the `sign-build` Maven profile must be activated, and the required properties set.
 1. Create and push a new release tag for the current release commit. 
 1. Go to the Github releases page and edit the newly present release. Add the corresponding ([ChangeLog.md](documentation/ChangeLog.md)) entries to the release notes. 
 1. Locally, run `ant -f releng/ CreateProjectSite`. This last step will prepare the project web site under `bin-maven/ProjectSite`.
 1. To actually publish the project site, run `ant -f releng/ PublishProjectSite -DreleaseTag=<tagName>`. What happens here is that the whole project site will be pushed into a Git repository, to then be served in some way (for example Github Pages). If `projectSiteGitURL` is not specified, the default value in releng-build.properties will be used.
   * For more info on the Release Engineering script, run `ant -f releng/`, this will print the help.
 1. A branch or tag named `latest` should also be created in Github, pointing to the latest release commit. The previous `latest` tag can be deleted/overwritten. The documentation pages use this tag/branch in their links.

## Project design info and notes

#### LangEclipseIDE
This project uses the LangEclipseIDE framework, which is designed to have its source embedded in the host IDE.
See [this section]( https://github.com/bruno-medeiros/LangEclipseIDE/blob/master/README-LangEclipseIDE.md#langeclipseide-source-embedding) for more info on how this should be managed.


#### Unit tests double-method wrapper:
 
What is this code idiom seen so often in Junit tests? :
```java
@Test
public void testXXX() throws Exception { testXXX$(); }
public void testXXX$() throws Exception {
```
This is donely solely as an aid when debugging code, so that the "Drop to frame" functionality can be used on the unit-test method. It seems the Eclipse debugger cannot drop-to-frame to a method that is invoked dynamically (such as the unit-test method). So we wrap the unit-test method on another one. So while we now cannot drop-to-frame in `testXXX`, we can do it in `testXXX$`, which basically allows us to restart the unit-test.

TODO: investigate if there is an alternate way to achieve the same. I haven't actually checked that.
