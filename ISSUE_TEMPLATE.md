Before submitting an issue:

 * Make sure you are using the latest Goclipse version. (This is displayed on `Help/About/Installation Details/Installed Software`)
 * If you are submitting a bug related to some external language tool (like gocode, gdb, etc.), also make sure you have an up-to-date version of the tool.
 * Check the Eclipse Error Log for any errors, especially Java exceptions, and if you find any that seem relevant to the bug, post them. The Error Log is available at `Help/About/Installation Details/Configuration/Error Log`.
