## Installation

#### Requirements: 
 * Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) or later (http://www.eclipse.org/).
 * A **1.7** Java SDK or later (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Otherwise GoClipse will silently fail to start.
 * Go development tools and libraries installed on target machine (http://golang.org/doc/install.html). Currently, only the plan 9 style compilers are supported. GCCGO may be supported in the future

#### Instructions:
 1. Use your existing Eclipse, or download a new Eclipse package from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. 
  * For an Eclipse package without any other IDEs or extras (such a VCS tools), download the ["Platform Runtime Binary"](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.3.1-201309111000/#PlatformRuntime). 
 1. Start Eclipse, go to `Help -> Install New Software...`
 1. Click the `Add...` button, then enter the Update Site URL: **http://goclipse.github.io/releases/** in the Location field, click OK.
 1. Select the recently added update site in the `Work with:` dropdown. Type `GoClipse` in the filter box. Now the Goclipse feature should appear below.
 1. Select the `GoClipse` feature, and complete the wizard. 
  * Dependencies such as CDT will automatically be added during installation.
 1. Restart Eclipse. After that take a look at the configuration section in the [User Guide](UserGuide.md#user-guide).
  

#### Updating:
If you already have GoClipse installed, and want to update it to a newer release, click `Help -> Check for Updates...`.
